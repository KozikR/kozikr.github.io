title: RC circuit!
---

New small project: simulation and identification RC circuit in Python. Jupyter notebook could be found [here](https://github.com/KozikR/Simulation-and-identification-of-RC-circuit/blob/master/RC%20circuit.ipynb).
First part was simulation. Then I used STM32discovery to catch some real data and identify  parameters.
